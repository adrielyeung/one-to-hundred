    <!-- Instruction -->
    <string name="instruction_1">1. The game consists of 1 judge and 2–9 players.</string>
    <string name="instruction_2">2. The judge will come up with a number between 1 and 100
        (excluding the two numbers). Let\'s call it the \"bomb number\".</string>
    <string name="instruction_3">3. The first player will select a number between 1 and 100,
        trying to avoid the bomb number.</string>
    <string name="instruction_4">4. If the first player did not hit the bomb number, the range of
        numbers available is reduced to between 1/100 and their chosen value, whichever contains
        the bomb number.</string>
    <string name="instruction_5">5. The next players keep on selecting numbers and reducing the
        range of available numbers until one unlucky player hits the bomb :(</string>
    <string name="instruction_6">Example: The bomb number is 60, and the first player selects 50
        among 1 to 100.</string>
    <string name="instruction_7">The available range is reduced to between 50 to 100.</string>
    <string name="instruction_8">The second player selects 70.</string>
    <string name="instruction_9">The available range is reduced to between 50 to 70.</string>
    <string name="instruction_10">The third player selects 60, which is the bomb number. BOOM!
        I guess he has to pay the bill…?</string>
